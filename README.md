This project transforms a smartphone into a precise, gyroscope-controlled mouse for a PC. Control is handled via a webpage on the phone, which sends sensor data (gyroscope &amp; accelerometer) to a Python server running on the PC. This server then translates the phone's movements into mouse actions.
